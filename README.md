# Overview
The code that was originally written completed the necessary jobs but it was something that did not scale well. If the dataset was expanded the inefficient code would get the desired results, but the user may end up waiting for the code to run. By taking the steps to refactor the code, it will run faster and still complete the required tasks.

This project includes an analysis of the efficiency of the code and will show that taking the steps to refactor does indeed decrease the time the user is waiting for the code to run.

# Results
The results of refactoring the code was positive. I was able to confirm that refactored code ran quicker and produced the same results. The original code took around 1 second to run for each of the years that it was run for. While the refactored code ran in 0.15 seconds. This resulted in around 85% time savings in the refactored code.
